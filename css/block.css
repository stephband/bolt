/**
.block

For layout. There are two ways a `.block` can be styled: as a
`block`, for a vertical layout, or as `inline-block`, for
a horizontal layout. `block` by default, obviously.

Applied to a media tag like img, svg, video and canvas, `.block`
will scale the element to fill the available width.

.block {
    display: block;

    /* Set as position parent */
    position: relative;

    /* Force img, video, svg to scale. */
    height: auto;

    /* Set them up to play nice as inline-blocks. */
    vertical-align: top;
    overflow: visible;

    /* Set them up to place nice as flexboxes. */
    justify-content: center;

    /* Negate possible spacing when .block is used on something typographic like
       a <p>, for example. Also, make blocks behave as centered wraps by default. */
    margin: 0 auto;
